**ML_Predictive Modeling for Agriculture**

This code trains a logistic regression model on each soil feature—Nitrogen ("N"), Phosphorus ("P"), Potassium ("K"), and pH ("ph")—to predict crop type. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, then evaluates each model’s performance using the F1-score, identifying "K" as the best predictive feature based on the highest F1-score.
